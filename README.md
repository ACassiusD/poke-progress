# 🌟 Poke-Tracker 🌟

**Poke-Tracker** is a completion and achievement tracker for Pokémon games. It aims to provide a gamut of features that aren't inherently tracked by the native games, like obtained TMs, berries, beauty contest ribbons, and also a platform to publish challenge runs.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: Our go-to library for building the user interface.
- **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)**: Handles navigation and URL management for our SPA.
- **[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)**: A UI framework to enhance our React app's appearance.

### Backend:
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Enables server-side JavaScript execution.
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)**: A minimalistic web framework for Node.js, simplifying API creation.
- **[Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/)**: Provides comprehensive Pokémon data, avoiding redundancy.

### Database (TBD):
- **SQL vs MongoDB**: A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) versus NoSQL (MongoDB) is still in deliberation, as both have their strengths.

### Authentication:
- **[JWT](https://jwt.io/)** (JSON Web Tokens): A compact method of representing information between two parties.

### Hosting/Deployment:
- **[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)**: A potential host for both our React frontend and Node.js backend.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: Another hosting option we're considering.
